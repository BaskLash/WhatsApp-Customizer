# WhatsApp Web Customizer

Compared to the preexisting browser addons, this reaches a whole new level, because it has been made for this reason.
Compared to other extension, this one embraces the WhatsApp Web Experience like it was just meant to be by WhatsApp itself, but it doesn't.

A lot of people are waiting for many features to be applied on the web version of whatsapp. But they are just too slow and can't even handle to deliver at a glance like it could have been made for Telegram.

But anyways, you have the possibility to change the color, font, background-images for loads of different sections and the best part is, you don't have to upload anything or reload the page ususally as you would have to do it for other extension, here you don't.

Also you see text bubbles on the chats, so that you can easily quick reply on a persons message, but that will be improved in the future.
